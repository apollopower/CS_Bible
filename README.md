# Computer Science - The True Software Engineer's Guide

This repo contains the work for a "definitive guide" of the major subjects all software engineers,regardless of discipline, should know. Its structure and information sources are all from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

## Overview

The following are the topics, in suggested order, that are covered in this study:

- [ ] Programming
- [ ] Computer Architecture
- [ ] Algorithms & Data Structures
- [ ] Math (for Computer Science)
- [ ] Operating Systems
- [ ] Computer Networking
- [ ] Databases
- [ ] Languages & Compilers
- [ ] Distributed Systems

The objectives are to create useful and extensive notes for each subject, while solving exercises from study resources and creating projects. Most of the resources used here are textbooks, but video lectures will also be referenced for those who have a preference.

## Who is this repo for? 

As suggested by the awesome authors of [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), anyone who is a self-taught engineer or bootcamp graduate owes it to themselves to learn true software engineering. The developer market is becoming more saturated over time, but the rapid increase of developers has come with more mediocre practitioners than true "unicorns". If as a developer you are interested in job security and growth in your career, these are subjects to study for you.

## Are there any prerequisites for following this Guide?

Short answer: No. The material covered here can be covered without any specific prerequisite knowledge. 

However, the more "hands on" experience you have had with software development, the more you will appreciate the topics covered. For logic and mathematical reasoning, high school math is enough to get by, and any concepts that might seem foreign to you are just a Google search away :)

## Recommended Study Outline

The suggested order of study is presented in the __Overview__ section of the README. In general, the goal for each subject is to follow the study material with care and effort. Here is roughly the steps to take for each section:

1. Read/Watch the primary source material.
2. Follow along by taking your own notes and/or using the provided notes.
3. Implement exercises for each section covered.
4. If there is a larger project/goal at the end of each subject, work on your own implementation as well.

The original authors highly recommend spending about 100-200 hours in each subject. This is a considerable amount of study, but should be covered if you follow the resource materials as suggested. Over time, you will probably want to come back to different subjects for reviews and further exploration.

## Additional Resources

Over time, we will add useful resources that supplement the topics in the __Teach Yourself Computer Science__ guide. The key work is _supplement_, so be sure not to substitute the core material for any of what is below; only add on top of it.
